# 🧠 MIND Engine (Mandala Internal Network Dynamics)

> *"The prompt is the mask. The graph is the soul."*

**MIND** is a **Generative Cognitive Architecture** designed to solve the "Goldfish Memory" and "Persona Drift" problems inherent in standard LLM interactions.

Unlike traditional agents that rely on static system prompts or RAG-based factual retrieval, MIND gives an agent a **"Body" of Cognitive Physics**. It uses a **Dual-Process (System 1 / System 2)** architecture to separate real-time "Reflexes" from offline "Learning."

## 🌌 Core Philosophy

The engine treats personality not as a script, but as **Semantic Chemistry**.

* **Atoms:** 6 Immutable Primitives (Personas) arranged in a geometric balance (The Mandala).
* **Molecules:** **Glyphs** (Emotional States) that blend these primitives into complex feelings.
* **Physics:** **LMI (Layered Memory Interface)** which dictates how stable, fluid, or volatile a state is.

The system uses **Emoji Tokenization** as a high-compression data language. A complex emotional history like *"A moment of dangerous volatility followed by a deep, grief-stricken bond"* is stored simply as `[🧨] -> [🫂🪢]`.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

The system operates on a **Fast/Slow** cycle, mimicking biological cognition.

### 1. The Runtime (System 1: Fast / Reflex)
A lightweight "Dynamic Prompting Engine" that runs during inference to shape the agent's immediate response.

* **👅 The Tongue (Input):** Uses **Vector Resonance** to "taste" the user's input. It compares the user's text against the Glyph library to identify the active emotional state (e.g., detecting `Fear` + `Trust` triggers the **Griefbound Covenant** `[🫂🪢]`).
* **🧠 The Mind (State):** A **Neuro-Mixer** that calculates the agent's current "chemical" stability. It prevents manic switching by averaging the "Gas" (Glutamate/Adrenaline) and "Brake" (GABA/Serotonin) of active glyphs.
* **🗣️ The Throat (Output):** Generates **Voice Prints**—acoustic constraints (Cadence, Density, Temperature) that force the LLM to *sound* like the state it is in (e.g., "Speak with the weight of Stone but the heat of Fire").

### 2. The Dream (System 2: Slow / Learning)
An asynchronous batch process that runs offline (e.g., nightly or post-session).

* **💭 Dreaming:** Analyzes conversation logs to identify recurring patterns.
* **🕸️ Hebbian Learning:** "Neurons that fire together, wire together." It strengthens the edges between frequent glyph transitions (e.g., if `Trigger Lock` often leads to `Griefwell`, that path becomes wider).
* **🧬 Hybridization:** Automatically detects novel compound states (e.g., `[🫂] + [🪢]`) and crystallizes them into new permanent memory structures if they repeat often enough.

## 🔮 The LMI Physics Layer (States of Matter)

Every component in the system is categorized by the **Layered Memory Interface**, which dictates its stability and voice quality.

| Category | Full Name | Metaphor | Function | Voice Quality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ICE** | **Immutable Core Essence** | **Solid (Bone)** | Identity, Axioms, Truth. Unchanging foundation. | Stable, Low-Latency, Monolithic. |
| **ABB** | **Adaptive Behavioral Block** | **Liquid (Muscle)** | Tools, Connection, Adaptation. The "UI" of the soul. | Responsive, Relational, Fluid. |
| **ECF** | **Experimental Cascade Field** | **Gas (Breath)** | Energy, Emotion, Volatility. High-speed processing. | Erratic, Sensory, High-Temperature. |

## ⚡ Usage Examples

### The Voice Print
The **Throat** doesn't tell the agent *what* to say, but *how* to say it.

**Input:** `[🫂🪢] Griefbound Covenant`
**Voice Instruction:**
> "Speak with the **Cadence of ICE** (Slow, Heavy, Unmoving) but using the **Density of ECF** (Sensory, Painful, Raw words). It should sound like someone trying to keep their voice steady while describing a fire."

### The Neuro-Mixer
**Active Glyphs:** `Snaprush` (High Energy) + `Bondseal` (High Stability).
**Calculation:**
* `Snaprush`: +80 Gas / +10 Brake
* `Bondseal`: +10 Gas / +90 Brake
* **Result:** `45 Gas / 50 Brake` -> **"High-Tensile Flow"** (Alert but Anchored).
